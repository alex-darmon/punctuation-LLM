  "strengths": [
    "Excellent use of Fleming's archaic vocabulary ('orgies', 'dolorous', 'vast', 'glorious', 'dreadful') and favorite adjectives integrated naturally throughout",
    "Strong implementation of common phrases ('as if', 'no doubt', 'to be sure', 'thank Heaven', 'in a manner most') that create authentic period voice",
    "Effective use of complex sentence structures with multiple clauses, semicolons, and em-dashes matching Fleming's punctuation style",
    "Good employment of melodramatic tone and Gothic dramatic flourishes ('like serpents from the grass', 'hell upon earth', 'thunderbolt from a clear sky')",
    "Successful cataloguing technique in descriptive passages, particularly in the funeral scene description"
  ],
  "improvements": [
    "Overuse of intensifiers and exclamatory constructions ('nay', 'most', 'utterly', 'exceedingly') creates excessive ornamentation that feels forced rather than natural",
    "Modern historical content sometimes clashes with 19th-century narrative voice, particularly in factual passages about treaties and political details",
    "Fleming's style includes wry humor and lighter touches that are largely absent here\u2014the tone is relentlessly heavy and dramatic throughout",
    "Some phrases are repetitive ('vast and horrible', 'dark and dolorous') where Fleming would vary her descriptive language more creatively",
    "The rewrite occasionally loses narrative momentum in favor of stylistic flourishes, whereas Fleming balanced ornate description with forward movement"
