  "strengths": [
    "Excellent use of archaic vocabulary including 'thy', 'thou', 'doth', 'hath', 'e'er', 'ne'er', 'o'er', 'twixt', and appropriate Shakespearean phrases like 'What ho', 'Mark', 'good friends'",
    "Strong deployment of Shakespearean literary devices including apostrophe ('O ancient enemies'), metaphor ('Russian bear and British lion'), personification (Time as character), and parallel constructions",
    "Effective use of inverted syntax and subordinate clauses ('Chief 'mongst these stood Wilhelm', 'whereof the ancient poets sang')",
    "Appropriate dramatic structure with Chorus narration, character entrances/exits, asides, and stage directions in Shakespearean format",
    "Good command of elevated, formal, and dramatic tone with rhetorical flourishes"
  ],
  "improvements": [
    "The verse does not consistently maintain iambic pentameter, which is fundamental to Shakespeare's style - many lines have irregular meter or wrong syllable counts",
    "Overuse of modern conceptual language that Shakespeare would not employ: 'naval rivalry', 'diplomatic resolution', 'historical context', 'virtue-signal' (especially jarring)",
    "Stage directions are too modern and explanatory ('as a ghost or memory', 'as monarchs or personifications') - Shakespeare's are minimal and functional",
    "The Chorus device, while Shakespearean, is used excessively here in ways more reminiscent of Greek drama than Shakespeare's typical structure where Chorus appears at act beginnings",
    "Some sentences remain too syntactically modern despite archaic vocabulary ('Germania plans not to conquer Britain' could be more inverted); needs more complex compound-complex structures"
