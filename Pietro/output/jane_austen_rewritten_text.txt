PART THE FIRST
The Great War

The relative stability which the monetary order enjoyed from the year 1873 coincided—and it must be acknowledged, most felicitously—with a stability of the political order; and as the world traded in one money, so too did it approach that excellent ideal of one economic unit, with declining restrictions upon trade and such reductions in military conflicts as gave considerable satisfaction to all reasonable observers. Relations between the major powers continued to improve over time; and the prospect of war, which had once seemed the natural state of affairs between rival nations, now appeared less and less likely—indeed, to those of sanguine disposition, it seemed almost to have receded beyond the horizon of probability. Britain and France, bitter rivals for centuries past, had signed the Entente Cordiale in 1904, an agreement which delineated the British and French colonies in North Africa, prevented further conflict between the countries, and led to a growing cooperation between the two empires; and if this alliance could not entirely erase the memory of ancient animosities, it at least promised a future in which such differences might be settled without recourse to arms. The Anglo-Russian relationships had likewise improved; the signing of the Anglo-Russian Convention in 1907 saw Britain and Russia delineate their Asian colonies with a view to avoiding any disagreeable conflict—a development which afforded no small relief to those who had long feared that the two empires' competing interests must inevitably lead to war.

Britain's relationship with Germany was also improving, though in a manner that depended rather more upon family connexion than upon any clear alignment of interests. Through the judicious—or perhaps merely prolific—royal marriages of her children to European monarchs, Britain's Queen Victoria had become grandmother to many royals across the continent; most notably the German Kaiser Wilhelm II, whose coronation in 1888 marked what appeared to be an auspicious moment for British-German relations, as he was the eldest of the forty-two grandchildren of Queen Victoria through her eldest daughter Princess Victoria—a circumstance which seemed to promise that family feeling might temper any political disagreements. At his birth, Wilhelm II had stood third in line for succession of the Prussian throne and sixth in line for succession of the British throne; such a position might have been expected to instill in him a proper sense of his dual heritage. When Queen Victoria lay upon her death bed in 1901, Wilhelm II, who professed to love her most dearly, travelled to be by her side; it is said that she passed away in his very arms, and that he carried her coffin at her funeral—demonstrations of filial devotion which could not but affect all who witnessed them, and which seemed to augur well for future relations between the two nations, whatever political differences might arise.

After its victory in the Franco-Prussian war, Germany had chused to focus upon consolidating its empire in the European mainland; and Britain and Germany approached the twentieth century with their interests apparently harmonized and the threat of war subsiding—or so it appeared to those who wished to believe that rational calculation must always prevail over passion and pride. Germany might dominate the European mainland whilst Britain expanded its empire everywhere else; such an arrangement seemed to promise lasting tranquility, provided neither power should grow too ambitious or too jealous of the other's sphere. An alliance between the two great powers was even seriously considered; Germany, however, eventually declined the proposal, fearing—not without some justice—that Britain's extensive imperial entanglements could draw them into an unwanted conflict with Britain's historic rivals Russia and France, or, most alarming prospect of all, with both at once.

From 1890 to 1902, however, three difficulties emerged in British-German relations which threatened to disturb the harmony that had been so carefully cultivated, and which demonstrated that family connexions, however close, could not entirely overcome the competing ambitions of great powers. Kaiser Wilhelm II removed Bismarck as chancellor and, with an impetuosity which his former adviser must have greatly lamented, ignored his counsel to avoid pursuing a foreign empire; this course inevitably aroused the distrust and discontent of the British, who possessed the world's greatest empire and viewed with considerable alarm any rival who should seek to compete with them for territories. Wilhelm II, not content with this provocation, became quite obsessed with building a navy to support such an empire—a project which could hardly fail to cause animosity in Britain, whose navy was the largest and most powerful in the world, and which controlled the entrance to the North Sea, Germany's naval gateway to the world; that the Kaiser should suppose Britain would view this development with equanimity spoke either to a remarkable want of understanding or to a deliberate indifference to British sensibilities.

The death of Queen Victoria in 1901 and the ascension of her son Edward VII to the throne added materially to the friction in British-German relations; for Kaiser Wilhelm suffered from a jealous rivalry with his uncle Edward, who had always regarded him rather as a young man and his nephew than as an equal ruling monarch of a superpower—a distinction which the Kaiser felt most acutely and resented most bitterly. Known, indeed, as "the possessor of the least inhibited tongue in Europe," Wilhelm had suffered injury at his birth which was thought to have caused him to be erratic, impulsive, and excessively emotional; whether this physical misfortune truly accounted for his temperament, or whether he was simply possessed of a disposition naturally inclined to such excess, must remain a matter of speculation; what could not be disputed was that his behaviour created needless tension between Germany and Britain that threatened to sour the increasingly cordial international order. In an infamous interview with The Daily Telegraph in October 1908, Kaiser Wilhelm's attempts at winning over British public opinion backfired most grievously; his outbursts caused increased tension not merely with Britain, but likewise with France, Russia, and Japan—a comprehensive failure which demonstrated that good intentions, when coupled with poor judgment and unrestrained expression, can produce consequences far worse than silence might have done. Wilhelm's naval and imperial ambitions alarmed the British exceedingly; and he, in turn, grew increasingly persuaded that Britain's rapprochement with France and Russia was designed expressly to encircle and suffocate Germany—a suspicion which, whether well-founded or not, was sufficient to poison his mind against any genuine reconciliation.

Yet these fears appeared to be alleviated in the second decade of the twentieth century, giving rise to renewed hopes that family feeling and mutual interest might yet prevail over suspicion and rivalry. After King Edward VII died, Kaiser Wilhelm II attended his funeral on the twentieth of May, 1910—a gesture which helped mend relations with the British people and royalty in a manner most agreeable to all parties. A popular king at the zenith of his empire, Edward VII's funeral procession drew an estimated three to five million people, with five and thirty thousand soldiers lining the route; from across Europe and the world, monarchs gathered at the palace in the greatest assemblage of monarchs to date—a spectacle which could not but impress even the most cynical observer with its magnificence and its apparent demonstration that the crowned heads of Europe, whatever their political differences, remained united by bonds of family and shared interest. The astonishing spectacle and sense of cordial solidarity suggested most strongly that the superpowers were entering upon a period of extended peace and cooperation; and those of optimistic temperament were inclined to believe that the new century might witness an end to the great conflicts that had so troubled the old. Mrs Tuchman has immortalized the occasion in a famous passage of her work, The Guns of August:

"So gorgeous was the spectacle on the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England that the crowd, waiting in hushed and black-clad awe, could not keep back gasps of admiration. In scarlet and blue and green and purple, three by three the sovereigns rode through the palace gates, with plumed helmets, gold braid, crimson sashes, and jeweled orders flashing in the sun. After them came five heirs apparent, forty more imperial or royal highnesses, seven queens—four dowager and three regnant—and a scattering of special ambassadors from uncrowned countries. Together they represented seventy nations in the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last. The muffled tongue of Big Ben tolled nine by the clock as the cortege left the palace, but on history's clock it was sunset, and the sun of the old world was setting in a dying blaze of splendor never to be seen again."

The new king, George V, ascended to the throne in 1910 with his first cousin ruling Germany, and his first cousins ruling Russia as Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra; such a proliferation of family connexions among the ruling houses of Europe seemed to offer some security against the outbreak of war, for surely cousins, however they might disagree, would not willingly slaughter each other's subjects. In 1913, the naval rivalry between Britain and Germany seemed quite at an end, as Germany agreed to keep its fleet inferior to Britain's at a ratio of ten to sixteen; and tensions over the Middle East had likewise been alleviated in June 1914 when Britain and Germany resolved their differences concerning the Baghdad Railway—an arrangement which afforded much satisfaction to those who believed that rational negotiation must always prove superior to armed conflict.

There were, it was true, tensions ever-present in the heartland of Europe, where ethnic and religious diversity created many small conflicts that threatened to involve the larger powers; yet it was not easy to imagine this difficulty snowballing into something of sufficient consequence to draw Britain in, for Britain, after all, had no vital interests in the European mainland, her true interests lying entirely in her overseas empire. "We are fish," Lord Salisbury had famously said, to explain his government's indifference to inter-European territorial disputes and its keen interest in the empire its magnificent navy made possible; and this principle seemed to promise that Britain might remain aloof from any Continental quarrel, however bitter it might become.

In 1913, Kaiser Wilhelm's daughter Princess Victoria Louise was married; her wedding, like King Edward's funeral, was a great gathering of European monarchs, suggesting a further dissipation of tensions most agreeable to all who valued peace. Any semblance of Anglo-German tension appeared to have quite vanished in the fateful final week of June 1914; the German Kaiser had joined the festivities of the annual Kiel Week Regatta, where he inaugurated the new Kiel Canal locks with all the ceremony such an occasion demanded. That year's regatta was an occasion of historical import, for it saw the invitation of Britain's Royal Navy's Second Battle Squadron, which comprised the four newest and most formidable dreadnaughts in the world; that the German Navy, which had grown to become the second largest in the world, should invite the greatest navy to this occasion signalled that the two navies had found a way to coexist peacefully, and that the naval rivalry between them, which had once seemed so intractable, was quite finished. Kaiser Wilhelm, who had been bestowed the rank of admiral in the British Navy by his grandmother—an honour which he valued perhaps more than any other—wore his British admiralty uniform to inspect the British warships, a gesture which could not but demonstrate the cordial relations between the two nations; indeed, to those present, it must have seemed that the Kaiser's dual loyalty to his own country and to his grandmother's kingdom had at last been reconciled. The evening of Saturday, the twenty-seventh of June, saw most boisterous celebrations as British and German sailors visited each other's boats, drank together, engaged in friendly boxing matches, and partied into the morning of the fateful day of June the twenty-eighth; at six o'clock in the evening of that day, with sailors still suffering the consequences of their merriment, news arrived of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire—intelligence which must at first have seemed merely shocking, but which could not yet have suggested to anyone the terrible chain of events it was to set in motion.

The news took all the joy from the events of the week and caused Kaiser Wilhelm to cut his visit short; he left Kiel the very next day, though whether from genuine distress or from some presentiment of the crisis to come cannot now be known. King George then sent a message delivered by the commander of the British squadron leaving Kiel on the thirtieth of June:

"Friends Today
Friends in Future
Friends Forever"

It was almost wholly inconceivable to anyone involved that these two navies should be at war in a mere five weeks; yet that, astonishingly and most lamentably, is exactly what came to pass—a turn of events so extraordinary and so contrary to all reasonable expectation that even those who lived through it could scarcely credit what was happening. Within the space of one week between July and August, Europe went from a comfortable optimism that Austria and Serbia were likely to find a diplomatic solution to their quarrel, to an all-out war engaging five major powers: Austria-Hungary, Russia, Germany, France, and Britain; three more powers were to follow over the coming months: Japan, the Ottoman Empire, and Italy—until it seemed that the entire world must be drawn into the conflict, however remote their interests in its original cause. To comprehend properly just how unlikely this calamity appeared at the time, one need only observe that the Serbian-Austrian crisis had not been mentioned in the British parliament for four weeks after it occurred; hardly anybody had even thought this affair carried any significance for the British, whose concerns lay so far from the Balkans that the assassination of an Austrian archduke seemed merely an unfortunate incident in a distant corner of Europe. On the twenty-fourth of July, British Prime Minister Mr Herbert Asquith wrote to his intimate friend Miss Venetia, "We are within measurable, or imaginable, distance of a real Armageddon. Happily there seems to be no reason why we should be anything more than spectators"—words which demonstrate how completely even the most informed observers misunderstood the situation; on the twenty-seventh of July, a day before Austria-Hungary declared war upon Serbia, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr David Lloyd George, said there could be no question of taking part in any war, and that he knew of no minister who was in favour of such a course—a statement which would prove embarrassingly premature within little more than a week.

On the fourth of August, Germany entered Belgium; on the fifth of August, the first battle of The Great War began: The Battle of Liège, which pitted the German army against the Belgian army in what was to prove merely the opening engagement of a conflict that would consume millions of lives. Liège fell on the sixteenth of August, and the German army continued its march through Belgium on its way to France, where one of the most brutal warfronts in history awaited them against the French and British armies—a campaign which all parties had expected to conclude within a few months, but which would instead drag on for more than four years.

On the twelfth of August, 1814, the Austro-Hungarian military under the command of General Oskar Potiorek launched its first offensive into Serbia, confidently expecting to crush the Serbian forces within a matter of weeks; hundreds of thousands of soldiers were killed and injured on both sides as Serbia succeeded in repelling the Austro-Hungarian attack—one of the greatest upsets in military history, and one which demonstrated that the smaller power, when fighting on its own soil for its very existence, might prove more than a match for a great empire. Soon after, on the seventeenth of August, Russia invaded the East Prussian province of Galicia and suffered grievous losses in a successful German counter-attack; at the Battle of Tannenberg, which took place the following week, Germany achieved a crushing defeat of Russia, setting that empire upon a most unfortunate footing from the very commencement of the war—a defeat so complete that Russia would never fully recover from it. On the twenty-third of May, 1915, Italy declared war upon Austria-Hungary and opened yet another front, abandoning her former allies in favour of territorial promises from Britain and France—a betrayal which shocked those who still believed that alliances and treaties possessed some moral force beyond mere calculation of advantage.

Perhaps no better testament to the senselessness of this war existed than the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers on the western front both decided to cease fighting over the Christmas holidays—without having received any orders to do so from their superiors, and indeed in defiance of military discipline—and crossed enemy lines to socialize and exchange gifts in a manner most extraordinary and most touching to all who heard of it. They even played a game of football together before returning to their trenches and resuming the dreadful slaughter—as if to demonstrate that the same young men who could meet as friends on Christmas Day could be induced to kill each other the following morning, provided only that their respective governments insisted upon it. The absurdity of the war was palpable to all who paused to consider it: German soldiers, many of whom had worked in England and liked the country exceedingly and learned to play football there, were now in France fighting the British army of King George V, Kaiser Wilhelm's own cousin; Germany had no plans to conquer Britain, and Britain had no plans to conquer Germany; consequently neither of these sets of soldiers felt any serious threat from one another, nor could they comprehend what vital interest required them to destroy each other. None of the poor soldiers could quite understand how things had spiralled so rapidly into large-scale war; nor could the diplomats and intellectuals in the respective countries explain it with any degree of satisfaction—though this did not prevent them from producing elaborate justifications for continuing the conflict. The Christmas truce laid bare the melancholy truth that these unfortunate soldiers had nothing against each other, had nothing to gain from prosecuting this dreadful war, and could see no reason whatsoever to continue it; whatever rivalry existed between these nations might very well have been settled peacefully on the football pitch at the cost of disciplined training rather than the blood of an entire generation—but such a sensible resolution was not to be, for the governments and generals who directed the war were not themselves required to do the fighting.

In the aftermath of the war, virtually nobody could explain with any certainty how the major powers had gone to war against each other; there was a general sense—melancholy but inescapable—that this was a disaster into which the major powers had inadvertently sleepwalked, driven by fears and suspicions that proved far more dangerous than any actual threat. After the assassination of the Austrian crown prince in Sarajevo by Serbian nationalists, Austria seemed exceedingly overconfident in its ability to bring Serbia to heel—a confidence born perhaps of long imperial dominance and a corresponding contempt for smaller nations; the Russians appeared most cavalier about defeating the Austrians in defence of Serbia, believing their great armies must inevitably prevail; the Germans, in turn, seemed gripped by a paranoia most unfortunate, with Kaiser Wilhelm's troubled disposition awakening fears that the British, French, and Russians were determined upon Germany's destruction—fears which, however exaggerated, were sufficient to drive Germany to act with desperate aggression. Rather than work to avoid a confrontation with the three powers, the Germans seemed to believe they could engage France, then Russia, all whilst Britain remained aloof—a calculation which proved disastrously wrong; the French appeared to have vastly overestimated their capacity to fight the Germans and regain Alsace-Lorraine, allowing desire for revenge to overcome prudent assessment of their military strength; and the British imagined their entry would decisively and quickly settle the matter, failing to comprehend that modern warfare had changed in ways that rendered old assumptions about the decisiveness of naval power and limited Continental commitment quite obsolete. They were all unfathomably mistaken in their estimations—a collective failure of judgment so complete that it must stand as one of history's great cautionary tales about the dangers of pride, suspicion, and wishful thinking.

There is, it must be allowed, a compelling case to be made that all of the parties deserve some portion of the blame for their overreaction and instigation; it is perhaps too comfortable an exercise for the historian to simply cast blame in all directions whilst appearing virtuous about peace being good and war exceedingly bad, without acknowledging the genuine difficulties and competing pressures that drove even well-intentioned leaders toward catastrophic decisions. Yet there was likewise a very real historical context in which this tragedy was born—one that had its roots in nineteenth century military conflicts and alliances, and in the imperial ambitions of monarchs who had grown quite indifferent to the true cost of their ambitions in men and treasure, having long ago ceased to lead their armies in person or to witness directly the carnage that resulted from their decisions.

As the war proceeded to a brutal stalemate and the belligerents seemed absolutely bent upon pursuing war at all costs, refusing every opportunity for negotiation or compromise, financing was to prove the decisive factor in determining the war's outcome; for however brave the soldiers or skilled the generals, modern warfare required resources on a scale that no previous conflict had demanded. All the major powers of the day were upon a classical gold standard; their central banks held considerable reserves of gold and issued paper notes and bank credit to their citizens in amounts that bore some reasonable relationship to those reserves. As war intensified, pressure upon these reserves increased across the world, for citizens naturally preferred to place their trust in the immutable laws of chemistry represented in gold rather than in the promises of governments that would do whatever it took to secure what appeared to be quite inconsequential victories—a preference which the governments found most vexing, but which they could not overcome by mere exhortation or appeal to patriotic duty.
