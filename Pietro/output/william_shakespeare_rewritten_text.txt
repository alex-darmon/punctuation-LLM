# PART THE FIRST
## The Great War

**Enter CHORUS**

**CHORUS:**  
Now mark, good friends, how from the year of grace  
One thousand, eight full hundred, seventy-three,  
The coin did mirror peace! As one money bound  
The trading world in golden harmony,  
So nations drew to unity—that state  
Where commerce flows unshackled and sweet Mars  
Doth sleep in chains. Relations 'twixt the powers  
Grew ever fair with time's soft-healing hand;  
War's prospect faded like a morning dream.  
Britain and France—O ancient enemies,  
Whose enmity had stained full many an age!—  
Did clasp their hands in th' Entente Cordiale  
Of nineteen hundred four. What meant this bond?  
'Twas naught but delineation of their realms  
In Africa, preventing civil strife  
And wedding two great empires in amity.  
The Russian bear and British lion too  
Made covenant in nineteen hundred seven,  
Marking their Asian spoils to keep the sword  
Within its scabbard. Thus the old world seemed  
To tend toward that golden age whereof  
The ancient poets sang.

**Enter BRITANNIA and GERMANIA as royal persons**

**BRITANNIA:**  
What of Germania?

**CHORUS:**  
Ay, there bloomed friendship fair!  
Through marriage-bonds Queen Victoria wrought—  
That web she wove across the continent—  
Britain's good Queen became the grandmother  
Of princes numberless. Chief 'mongst these stood  
Wilhelm, Germania's Kaiser, who received  
His crown in eighteen hundred eighty-eight.  
This Wilhelm, eldest of two-score and two  
Grandchildren sprung from Victoria's line  
Through her dear Princess Victoria, stood third  
In line for Prussia's throne, and sixth in line  
For Britain's crown itself.

**GERMANIA:**  
When Death, that pale horseman,  
Came for the aged Queen in nineteen one,  
I made my pilgrimage unto her chamber.

**BRITANNIA:**  
They say she breathed her last within thine arms.

**GERMANIA:**  
'Tis truth. I bore her coffin at the rites.  
O grief! What tongue can speak a grandchild's loss?

**CHORUS:**  
After the Franco-Prussian war's bright conquest,  
Germania bent all purpose to her realm  
Upon the continent. So Britain and  
Germania approached the century new  
Like brothers whose interests ne'er did clash:  
Let Germania hold Europa's heartland  
Whilst Britannia ruled the waves and seas!  
An alliance 'tween these powers was proposed—  
Nay, seriously debated! Yet at last  
Germania refused it.

**GERMANIA:**  
We did fear  
Britannia's far-flung quarrels might ensnare us  
In unwanted war with Russia or with France—  
Or both at once! Horror unthinkable!

**CHORUS:**  
Yet from eighteen hundred ninety on  
To nineteen hundred two, three serpents crept  
Into this Eden. First: the Kaiser dismissed  
Wise Bismarck from his chancellorship and scorned  
His counsel.

**BISMARCK (appearing as a ghost or memory):**  
Build not empires far and wide!  
Keep to thy continental lands! Beware  
Of provoking jealous Albion's wrath!

**GERMANIA (turning away):**  
Old man, thy day is past. I'll seek dominions  
Where'er I will, and build a navy strong  
To rival England's fleet!

**BRITANNIA (aside):**  
What's this? Germania  
Doth lust for colonies and navies both?  
We'll not brook such a rival! We possess  
The greatest empire e'er the sun shone on,  
The most puissant navy e'er did ride  
The ocean's back. Germania shall not  
Command the North Sea's gates—her only passage  
To all the wider world.

**CHORUS:**  
When Victoria died  
And Edward, seventh of that name, ascended  
To th' throne, the friction multiplied. The Kaiser  
Bore jealous rivalry with Edward, who  
Had ever looked upon him as a boy,  
A nephew, not an equal sovereign monarch.  
They called Wilhelm "possessor of the least  
Inhibited tongue in all Europa."

**COURTIER:**  
Poor wretch! Birth's violence damaged his very brain,  
Rendering him erratic, impulsive, ruled  
By wild and changing passion.

**CHORUS:**  
His behavior  
Created needless storms. In October  
Of nineteen hundred eight, that infamous  
Interview with The Daily Telegraph!  
Wilhelm's attempts to win the British hearts  
Did grievously miscarry.

**GERMANIA (speaking publicly):**  
Know, good people  
Of England, that I am your friend! My heart—

**BRITANNIA (interrupting):**  
His outbursts breed but tension—not with us  
Alone, but France and Russia too, and Japan!

**FRANCIA:**  
We trust him not!

**RUSSIA:**  
His words ring false and hollow!

**GERMANIA (to himself):**  
They circle me! Britannia's new friendship  
With Francia and with Russia is a noose  
To strangle Germany!

**CHORUS:**  
But hark! When Edward  
The Seventh died, Wilhelm attended well  
His funeral—that twentieth of May  
In nineteen hundred ten—and helped to mend  
The breach. Edward was beloved, his empire  
At its zenith; his funeral drew three  
To five million souls! Five-and-thirty thousand  
Soldiers lined the solemn route. From every  
Corner of the earth came monarchs—the greatest  
Gathering e'er assembled!

**HERALD:**  
Nine kings ride!  
So gorgeous is the spectacle this May  
Morning of nineteen ten, when nine kings ride  
In funeral of Edward the Seventh  
Of England, that the crowd, which waits in hushed  
And black-clad awe, cannot keep back their gasps  
Of admiration! In scarlet and in blue  
And green and purple, three by three the sovereigns  
Ride through the palace gates, with plumèd helms,  
Gold braid, crimson sashes, and jeweled orders  
Flashing in the sun!

**CHORUS:**  
After them came five  
Heirs apparent, forty more imperial  
Or royal highnesses, seven queens—four dowager  
And three regnant—and special ambassadors  
From uncrowned countries, representing full  
Three-score and ten nations in the greatest  
Assemblage of royalty and rank  
E'er gathered in one place and, of its kind,  
The last.

**TIME (as a character):**  
The muffled tongue of Big Ben tolled  
Nine by the clock as the cortège departed  
The palace, but on history's clock it was  
Sunset, and the sun of th' old world was setting  
In a dying blaze of splendor ne'er  
To be seen again.

**CHORUS:**  
Now George, the Fifth of that name,  
Ascended to the throne in nineteen ten,  
His first cousin ruling Germany,  
His cousins Nicholas and Alexandra  
Ruling Russia. By nineteen thirteen,  
The naval rivalry seemed dead at last.

**GERMANIA:**  
Our fleet shall stand to Britain's as ten stands  
To sixteen. We'll not challenge Albion's rule  
Upon the seas.

**BRITANNIA:**  
'Tis well. And we resolve  
Our differences touching the Baghdad  
Railway this June of nineteen fourteen.

**CHORUS:**  
True, the European heartland yet did simmer  
With ethnic and religious strife—small quarrels  
Threatening to embroil the greater powers.  
But how could such petty squabbles draw  
Britannia in?

**LORD SALISBURY:**  
We are fish! Our government  
Cares not for continental land-grabs, but  
For th' empire our magnificent navy  
Makes possible!

**CHORUS:**  
In nineteen hundred thirteen,  
Wilhelm's daughter, fair Victoria Louise,  
Was wed. Her wedding brought another great  
Gathering of monarchs—further proof  
That tensions had dissolved! Any shadow  
Of Anglo-German enmity seemed vanished  
In that fateful final week of June  
In nineteen hundred fourteen.

**Enter SAILORS, BRITISH and GERMAN**

**GERMAN SAILOR:**  
Come, friends! The Kaiser  
Joins the annual Kiel Week Regatta!

**BRITISH SAILOR:**  
And we,  
Britain's Royal Navy's Second Battle Squadron,  
Are invited! Four of th' world's newest,  
Most fearsome dreadnoughts!

**GERMAN SAILOR:**  
The naval rivalry  
Is done! Finished! We'll live as peaceful neighbors!

**CHORUS:**  
Wilhelm, wearing the British admiral's  
Uniform his grandmother bestowed,  
Inspected British warships. Saturday evening,  
The twenty-seventh of June, brought boisterous  
Celebration.

**BRITISH SAILOR:**  
Come aboard our vessel! Drink!

**GERMAN SAILOR:**  
And you to ours! Let's have some friendly boxing!

**ALL SAILORS (singing and carousing):**  
We'll revel till the morning light appears!

**CHORUS:**  
At six o'clock that evening of the twenty-eighth  
Of June—the sailors nursing still their sore heads—  
News arrived.

**MESSENGER (rushing in):**  
What ho! Grave news from Sarajevo!  
Archduke Franz Ferdinand—heir to  
Austria-Hungary's throne—is murdered!  
Assassinated by Serbian hands!

**GERMANIA (sobering):**  
This news  
Steals all the joy from our festivities.  
I must depart from Kiel with haste. Farewell!

*Exit GERMANIA*

**KING GEORGE:**  
Commander! Bear this message to the fleet  
Departing Kiel this thirtieth of June:  
"Friends today, friends in future, friends forever!"

**CHORUS:**  
'Twas inconceivable—nay, impossible!—  
That these two navies would be at war within  
Five weeks! Yet so it came to pass. Within  
One week 'twixt July and August, all Europa  
Transformed from optimism—that Austria  
And Serbia would find diplomatic  
Resolution—to all-out war!

**Enter FIVE POWERS as monarchs or personifications: AUSTRIA-HUNGARY, RUSSIA, GERMANIA, FRANCIA, and BRITANNIA**

**AUSTRIA-HUNGARY:**  
Serbia must answer for this outrage!

**RUSSIA:**  
We stand with Serbia 'gainst thy tyranny!

**GERMANIA:**  
And we with Austria-Hungary! Russia,  
Thou shalt not pass!

**FRANCIA:**  
Germania threatens? Then  
We stand with Russia!

**BRITANNIA:**  
And I with Francia!

**CHORUS:**  
Thus  
Five major powers fell to conflict: Austria-  
Hungary, Russia, Germania, Francia,  
And Britannia—with three more to follow  
In coming months: Japan, th' Ottoman Empire,  
And Italy. How unlikely seemed  
This catastrophe!

**ASQUITH (British Prime Minister, writing):**  
"We are within  
Measurable, or imaginable,  
Distance of a real Armageddon.  
Happily there seems to be no reason  
Why we should be anything more  
Than spectators." Thus I write my lover  
Venetia, this twenty-fourth of July.

**LLOYD GEORGE (Chancellor of the Exchequer):**  
This twenty-seventh of July I say  
There can be no question of our taking  
Part in any war. I know no minister  
Who favors it.

**CHORUS:**  
Yet on th' fourth of August,  
Germania entered Belgium.

**GERMANIA:**  
Forward, march!

**CHORUS:**  
On th' fifth of August began the first  
Battle of The Great War: Liège—German  
Army 'gainst Belgian.

**BELGIAN COMMANDER:**  
We shall not yield!

**CHORUS:**  
Liège fell on the sixteenth of August.  
The German army marched through Belgium  
Toward Francia, where one of history's most  
Brutal warfronts awaited.

**FRANCIA and BRITANNIA (together):**  
Here we stand!  
Germania shall not pass!

**CHORUS:**  
On the twelfth  
Of August, Austria-Hungary's military—  
Commanded by General Oskar  
Potiorek—launched its first offensive  
Into Serbia.

**AUSTRIA-HUNGARY:**  
We'll bring Serbia to heel!

**SERBIA (defiant):**  
We'll not be conquered! To arms, my countrymen!

**CHORUS:**  
Hundreds of thousands were slain and wounded  
On both sides! Yet Serbia—'gainst all  
Expectation—fended off th' Austrian  
Attack. 'Twas one of the greatest upsets  
In military history! Soon after,  
On the seventeenth of August, Russia  
Invaded the East Prussian province  
Of Galicia.

**RUSSIA:**  
Forward! For Serbia's honor!

**GERMANIA:**  
Not so fast, Russian bear! We'll counter-attack!

**CHORUS:**  
Russia suffered great losses in Germania's  
Successful counter-attack. At Tannenberg  
The following week, Germania achieved  
Crushing victory o'er Russia—setting  
The Russian bear upon the wrong foot from  
The war's very start. On the twenty-third  
Of May in nineteen fifteen, Italy  
Declared war upon Austria-Hungary,  
Opening yet another front.

**ITALY:**  
We join the fray!

**CHORUS:**  
Perhaps no better proof of this war's  
Senselessness existed than the Christmas  
Truce of nineteen fourteen.

**Enter GERMAN and ENGLISH SOLDIERS on opposite sides**

**GERMAN SOLDIER:**  
Brothers! 'Tis Christmas!  
Shall we not cease our fighting for this holy  
Season?

**ENGLISH SOLDIER:**  
Aye! Without our commanders' orders,  
Let us make peace!

**GERMAN SOLDIER (crossing to the English side):**  
I come to exchange gifts!

**ENGLISH SOLDIER:**  
And I to thee! Come, let us play football  
Together as friends!

**CHORUS:**  
So they played football together  
Before returning to their trenches to resume  
The senseless slaughter. The war's absurdity  
Was palpable.

**GERMAN SOLDIER (to himself):**  
I worked in England once.  
I loved that country well, learned football there.  
Now here in Francia I fight the British  
Army of King George—Wilhelm's own cousin!  
Germania plans not to conquer Britain;  
Britain plans not to conquer Germany.  
I feel no threat from these English soldiers.  
How did things spiral so swiftly into war?

**ENGLISH SOLDIER (to himself):**  
I bear no malice toward these German lads.  
What gain I from this war? I see no reason  
To continue it. This rivalry between  
Our nations might be settled on the pitch—  
At cost of disciplined training rather than  
The blood of our entire generation!

**CHORUS:**  
In th' war's aftermath, virtually no one  
Could explain how the major powers went  
To war against each other. There was sense  
That this was a disaster into which  
They inadvertently sleepwalked.

**AUSTRIA-HUNGARY (reflecting):**  
After  
The crown prince's assassination  
In Sarajevo by Serbian nationalists,  
We seemed o'er-confident in our ability  
To bring Serbia to heel.

**RUSSIA (reflecting):**  
We seemed exceeding  
Cavalier about smashing Austria  
In Serbia's defense.

**GERMANIA (reflecting):**  
We seemed gripped by  
Paranoia—my demons awakened!—  
Imagining Britannia, Francia,  
And Russia aimed at our destruction.  
Rather than avoid confrontation with  
These three powers, we thought we could take on  
Francia, then Russia, whilst Britannia  
Stood aside.

**FRANCIA (reflecting):**  
We vastly overestimated  
Our ability to fight Germania  
And regain Alsace-Lorraine.

**BRITANNIA (reflecting):**  
We imagined  
Our entry would decisively and quickly  
Settle the war.

**ALL POWERS (together):**  
We were unfathomably wrong!

**CHORUS:**  
'Tis easy to cast blame everywhere—  
To virtue-signal that peace is good and war  
Is ill. Yet there was real historical  
Context birthing this tragedy: roots deep  
In nineteenth-century military conflicts  
And alliances, in imperial ambitions  
Of monarchs grown callous to the true cost  
Of their dreams in men's lives and treasure's loss.  
As war ground toward brutal stalemate and  
Belligerents seemed hell-bent on pursuing  
War at all costs, financing proved decisive  
In determining th' outcome. All major  
Powers of the day operated on  
A classical gold standard.

**BANKER:**  
Our central banks  
Hold large gold reserves and issue paper  
Notes and bank credit to our subjects.

**CHORUS:**  
As  
War intensified, pressure upon these  
Reserves increased across the world.

**CITIZEN:**  
Why so?

**BANKER:**  
Because we citizens prefer to trust  
In gold's immutable chemical laws  
O'er governments' promises to do  
Whate'er it takes to secure victories  
That seem but inconsequential.

**CHORUS:**  
Thus stands  
The matter as we enter now the dark  
And bloody heart of this great conflict. Mark  
What follows, friends, and learn from history's  
Harsh lessons what the cost of pride may be.

*Exeunt omnes*
